1
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:38,098
Hah! Hah!

2
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:40,902
Hah! Hah!

3
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,804
Hah!

4
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:44,939
Hah! Hah!

5
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:18,740
It's freezing.

6
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,777
Nah, that doesn't sound good.

7
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,913
Bike, bike, bike, bike! Whoa!

8
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,351
So, a photon is checking
into a hotel.

9
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:45,753
Can we not do jokes
right now, please?

10
00:04:45,887 --> 00:04:46,821
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

11
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,491
Whoa!

12
00:04:51,626 --> 00:04:53,326
Red light! Red light!

13
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,494
The bellhop asks,

14
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:55,730
"Do you need help
with your luggage?"

15
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,765
To which the photon responds,
"No, thanks.

16
00:04:57,899 --> 00:04:59,066
I'm traveling light."

17
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,902
Wow.

18
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:03,771
Hey, can we get some air going
back here? It's like a furnace.

19
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,674
No air.

20
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:08,876
Also no power.

21
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,443
Trev, we need power!

22
00:05:10,578 --> 00:05:11,846
Can you not talk to me
like that, please?

23
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,215
-I'm 18 now. I'm an adult.
-Oh, come on.

24
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,684
-We're on a job, buddy.
-I'm not getting paid.

25
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:18,653
-Are you getting paid? Cool.
-No.

26
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:19,987
Does anyone else
feel exploited?

27
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,122
We're all being paid--

28
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,322
with memories.

29
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,390
Ow!

30
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,826
-Oh, you're fine.
-Oh.

31
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,695
Actually, guys, I'm fine.
Mom says I'm fine. Welcome.

32
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:33,100
Oh!

33
00:05:33,234 --> 00:05:35,803
Wonderful news from the back
seat. The windows are stuck.

34
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,038
I can open a door.

35
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,172
-No, no, no. No!
-No, Pheebs, no. We said!

36
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,807
Not during rush hour.
No gunner seat.

37
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,689
Ugh. Gross.

38
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:56,791
It's the Hell's Kitchen
Sewer Dragon.

39
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,696
Hold on to your ass!

40
00:06:07,301 --> 00:06:08,368
-I'm going out.
-Phoebe.

41
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,038
-What, Callie?
-I'm Mom. You call me Mom.

42
00:06:11,172 --> 00:06:12,707
Call me Gary,
or whatever you want.

43
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,609
-I-I don't care.
-We're gonna lose him.

44
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:17,477
Phoebe Spengler,
you stay inside this car.

45
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:19,113
I have a ghost to bust.

46
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,718
All right. That was cool.

47
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,452
-Gary, come on.
-No, I know. I'm sorry.

48
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:27,054
It's just, the way she said it,
it sounded cool.

49
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,457
Get back in here!

50
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:33,127
I can't hear you
over the nuclear accelerator.

51
00:06:47,942 --> 00:06:49,010
Whoa!

52
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,847
-Drop it!
-Okay. Maybe a "please."

53
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,789
I'm sweating bullets.

54
00:07:06,027 --> 00:07:07,161
In pursuit.

55
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:08,495
Nah.

56
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:09,897
They got it.

57
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:15,236
These roads are screwed.

58
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:17,138
-Try driving a ten-ton hearse.
-I have.

59
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,438
And if you give me the keys,

60
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,840
-then maybe we...
-Not now, Trevor.

61
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,111
Now! Trevor!

62
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,478
Pop it, Trev!

63
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:40,695
-I'm out of range.
-On it.

64
00:07:47,134 --> 00:07:48,769
Good luck, Mom.

65
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,578
Come on.

66
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,664
Later, gator.

67
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,204
Got it!

68
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,271
-You got it?
-Yeah! Got it!

69
00:08:24,405 --> 00:08:26,507
-Yes!
-Yes! Yes!

70
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,109
Whoo!

71
00:08:28,242 --> 00:08:29,610
Phoebe!

72
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,867
-Everyone okay?
-Oh, God.

73
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,404
Who puts bikes there?

74
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,847
The city ground
to a halt today

75
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,216
as a high-speed ghost chase
tore up

76
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,651
portions of Lower Manhattan.

77
00:09:10,785 --> 00:09:12,219
Honestly, looking at this,

78
00:09:12,353 --> 00:09:13,687
I'm surprised
nobody got killed.

79
00:09:13,821 --> 00:09:14,789
We haven't seen
the Ghostbusters

80
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:15,956
cause this much damage since

81
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,660
the Statue of Liberty
debacle of 1989.

82
00:09:19,794 --> 00:09:20,961
Last year, descendants of

83
00:09:21,095 --> 00:09:23,097
original Ghostbusters founder
Egon Spengler

84
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:26,100
were handed the keys
to the derelict firehouse,

85
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,502
bankrolled by philanthropist

86
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,937
and former Ghostbuster
Winston Zeddemore.

87
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:33,140
And though it's been decades
since New Yorkers cheered...

88
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:37,044
Break out the new equipment!

89
00:09:37,178 --> 00:09:38,547
The Nutrona Blaster charged!

90
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,648
...today's question
isn't, "Who you gonna call?"

91
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:43,384
It's, "Who's gonna pay
for this mess?"

92
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:46,454
Three lampposts,
two parked Priuses,

93
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,090
an entire fleet
of rental bikes.

94
00:09:51,526 --> 00:09:53,294
That is a lot of damage.

95
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,496
Yeah, but you can't have
a Sewer Dragon

96
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,231
flying around SoHo
like it's Middle-earth.

97
00:09:57,364 --> 00:10:00,968
You have someone hanging out
the side of a moving vehicle,

98
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,337
firing a laser gun
indiscriminately...

99
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:06,140
Laser gun? What?
That's a proton pack.

100
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,509
It's a weapon.

101
00:10:07,641 --> 00:10:08,609
A weapon of science.

102
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:10,277
It's completely safe.

103
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,645
It's not completely safe.

104
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,582
It's a portable
proton accelerator.

105
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:15,015
How old are you?

106
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,350
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

107
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:18,252
I'm not talking to you. Her.

108
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,256
-Fifteen.
-A minor.

109
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,325
We don't let kids become cops,

110
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,993
we don't let them fight fires,

111
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:29,163
and we certainly don't let them
become Ghostbusters.

112
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,631
-Uh, Mister-Mister...
-Sir.

113
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,967
I-I'm sorry. Uh, Mr. Mayor,
m-may I approach the bench?

114
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,836
Do you see a robe?
I am not a judge.

115
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:41,742
Gary.

116
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:45,614
Uh, look, uh, y-you don't know
Phoebe Spengler like-like I do.

117
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:48,048
I mean, she is something else,
this kid.

118
00:10:48,182 --> 00:10:50,718
Honestly, she's more focused,
more accomplished,

119
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:53,287
more capable than just about
any other adult I know.

120
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,057
And what exactly is your
relationship to this minor?

121
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:59,059
Are you her parent?

122
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,694
I mean...

123
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,797
Labels.
No, I'm her step-teacher.

124
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:06,400
Mr. Grooberson,
you are not her father.

125
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:07,835
You are her employer.

126
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,403
No, uh, we don't pay her.

127
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:11,472
Sounds like we can add
child labor

128
00:11:11,606 --> 00:11:12,907
-to our list of violations.
-Uh...

129
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,675
-Gary.
-Yeah.

130
00:11:14,808 --> 00:11:16,911
Maybe she can become
a junior Ghostbuster,

131
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,146
hand out stickers or something.

132
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,781
As for the rest of you,

133
00:11:20,915 --> 00:11:22,783
I am personally holding you
responsible,

134
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:26,787
and I won't stop until
that firehouse you call a home

135
00:11:26,921 --> 00:11:28,355
is a pile of bricks.

136
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:36,363
Mom?

137
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,666
The ceiling's leaking again.

138
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:39,668
Sounds like a fun mystery
for a boy detective.

139
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,935
Yeah, the mystery
of the black mold.

140
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,803
Super fun mystery,
and you're gone.

141
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:44,872
Awesome. Awesome.

142
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,975
-Flight suit.
-It's not fair.

143
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:50,778
Maybe you can spend the next few
years being an actual teenager.

144
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,146
Yeah, well,
if this was the 18th century,

145
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:53,814
then I'd already be
a part of the workforce

146
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:54,915
and I'd have four kids.

147
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,586
Aw. So I'd be a grandmother.

148
00:11:57,718 --> 00:12:00,287
No, you would be dead.

149
00:12:00,421 --> 00:12:03,123
So sweet.
A ghost grandma.

150
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:04,925
-Ooh, tacos.
-Ooh.

151
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:06,760
Hey, look what I found
for movie night.

152
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:08,062
Is that family friendly?

153
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,598
I hope not.

154
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,432
It's about a family--
a family that eats people.

155
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:12,567
They're sisters.

156
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:13,767
-Trap.
-If that counts for anything.

157
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,935
I'm gonna take this
to the labor board.

158
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:16,770
-On what grounds?
-I'm a Ghostbuster.

159
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,005
I saved the world.

160
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,674
Well, I like to think
we saved the world.

161
00:12:19,807 --> 00:12:21,442
Hey, could you, uh,
watch my beans?

162
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:23,077
You were a possessed canine.

163
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,279
Ghost dog!

164
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:27,915
This is insane.

165
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:30,552
Man, they got into
the snacks again!

166
00:12:30,685 --> 00:12:31,952
So you're gonna make me wait
till I'm 18?

167
00:12:32,086 --> 00:12:33,320
Aw, it's just three years.

168
00:12:33,454 --> 00:12:35,155
-Be young. Live a little.
-This is the time

169
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,925
in your life when it's okay to
screw up, make some mistakes.

170
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:40,027
Yeah, you have the rest of
your life to be a Ghostbuster.

171
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,895
Okay, well, three years
is nothing for you guys.

172
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,498
It's a tiny, negligible
percentage of your lifespan.

173
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:46,100
-She means we're old.
-Yeah, I got that.

174
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:48,002
You're not the only
Spengler here, you know.

175
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,236
Okay, well, this is my calling.

176
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:51,939
You just, like, decided
to be a Ghostbuster.

177
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,173
So did I.

178
00:12:53,307 --> 00:12:55,543
I mean, I was studying
earthquakes in Oklahoma.

179
00:12:55,677 --> 00:12:56,944
Then I went to dinner
with your mom and...

180
00:12:57,077 --> 00:12:58,613
...we turned into dogs.

181
00:12:58,747 --> 00:12:59,947
And fulfilled
an ancient prophecy

182
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,482
that almost brought about
the end of the world.

183
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:02,850
Now, that's a first date.

184
00:13:02,983 --> 00:13:04,785
We both got some action.

185
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:06,820
-Yeah, we did.
-Okay, gross.

186
00:13:06,954 --> 00:13:09,256
For you, I get it--
you're a scientist--

187
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,759
but... she's just...

188
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:13,460
Choose your next words
very carefully.

189
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,998
I didn't think
she even knew those words.

190
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:20,000
You could've backed me up.
It's great you're their buddy,

191
00:13:20,134 --> 00:13:22,369
but sometimes you need
to be an asshole.

192
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:24,071
Well, is that really my place?

193
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,205
I hope so.

194
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:26,874
I... You know.

195
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,175
I want to be more
than just their buddy.

196
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,044
I just don't know
what's allowed.

197
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:32,514
Permission granted.

198
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:35,382
Okay. Great.

199
00:13:37,084 --> 00:13:40,220
Although I got to warn you,
I mean, I can be scary.

200
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:41,523
Yeah, you're a monster.

201
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,059
You have no i...

202
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,161
Don't look at me that way.

203
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,798
You laugh... Hey!
You laughing in my face?!

204
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:51,800
I'm so sorry.
That was really bad.

205
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:54,935
I-I scare myself sometimes.
I'll be nice to you.

206
00:13:55,069 --> 00:13:56,604
I'll just be an asshole
to your kids.

207
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:58,205
That's what I want.

208
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:00,274
All right, who's hungry?

209
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:16,725
Is the containment unit okay?

210
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,193
Come on, there's always room
for one more ghost.

211
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,766
When the...
when the light is green...

212
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,000
Come on!

213
00:14:27,134 --> 00:14:28,837
When the light is green...

214
00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:39,880
The trap is clean.

215
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,457
We're rolling in three, two...

216
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:57,931
Greetings, ethereal beings,
subhuman entities

217
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,968
and spectral forms
from the great beyond

218
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:04,438
and any living humans
who may be watching.

219
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:07,709
Welcome to "Repossessed,"
the show where we measure

220
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:10,377
the spiritual energy
of everyday objects.

221
00:15:11,412 --> 00:15:14,114
I'm your host,
Dr. Raymond Stantz.

222
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:18,520
My, uh, young producer-intern
reminds me to ask you

223
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,755
that if you like
what you see here,

224
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:22,891
-please push...
-Like.

225
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,860
-Like... and subscribe.
-And subscribe.

226
00:15:25,993 --> 00:15:27,995
Now, who do we have here?

227
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:33,133
Oh.

228
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,571
I brought my late husband
Harold's watch.

229
00:15:37,605 --> 00:15:39,339
He wore it every day.

230
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,709
And now when I walk
in the room...

231
00:15:41,843 --> 00:15:45,045
it beeps.

232
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,849
Well, any object
that's been exposed

233
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:52,085
to a deep emotional experience
can bind a spirit.

234
00:15:52,219 --> 00:15:53,153
I see.

235
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:54,955
An organic ghost trap,
if you will.

236
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:57,157
The stronger the experience
or even trauma,

237
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,726
the more powerful the trap.

238
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,495
-Wow.
-The way we detect this energy

239
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,798
is with one of these babies.

240
00:16:03,932 --> 00:16:05,934
Oh, thank you.

241
00:16:06,066 --> 00:16:07,802
-If there's anything there...
-Mm-hmm.

242
00:16:07,936 --> 00:16:09,369
...this item will detect it.

243
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:17,044
Harold, beep for the nice man.

244
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:21,315
Are you getting anything?

245
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,818
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but it seems that

246
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:27,421
your dearly departed spirit has
left this earthly dimension.

247
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:30,592
Sorry, lady.

248
00:16:30,725 --> 00:16:32,025
The hammer gets the views.

249
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,428
He was gone anyway. Next!

250
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,398
I'm telling you,

251
00:16:38,533 --> 00:16:40,735
it's gonna be
another hot one out there.

252
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,069
In fact...

253
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,104
-Hey, Dr. Ray.
-Phoebe!

254
00:16:44,238 --> 00:16:46,006
-Hot one.
-Yeah.

255
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,375
Um, here's the sample
of mood slime you requested.

256
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,010
Oh. Put it downstairs.

257
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,212
Here, I'll show you.

258
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,148
So, you're, like,
sleeping down here?

259
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,184
Yeah. Normally,
Ray rents this place

260
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,687
to Norwegian ghost hunting
clubs on Booking.com,

261
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:01,288
and I just got lucky.

262
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,858
It sure beats another
boring summer in Dorklahoma.

263
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:06,026
So, catch anything crazy
lately?

264
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,361
Anything try to bite
your arm off,

265
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,564
like Class Five, Class Seven?

266
00:17:09,697 --> 00:17:10,899
No, I've been benched.

267
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,636
Oh, hold on.

268
00:17:17,404 --> 00:17:20,140
Mm. I told my parents
I was at Space Camp.

269
00:17:23,176 --> 00:17:24,478
We are go for launch.

270
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:27,314
T-minus 15,

271
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:30,417
14, 13, 12...

272
00:17:30,552 --> 00:17:31,920
Hi.

273
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,556
Hi.

274
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,858
Orbit. I'll talk to you guys
later. Love you. Bye.

275
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:38,993
...seven, six...

276
00:17:39,126 --> 00:17:40,728
Yeah.

277
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:49,102
-What are you doing?
-It's a nightmare.

278
00:17:50,672 --> 00:17:53,173
Ray smuggled them back
from Summerville.

279
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,011
I'm pretty sure they're mating.

280
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,559
Disgusting.

281
00:18:23,337 --> 00:18:25,506
That's odd.

282
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:30,477
You the weird guy
who buys strange old things?

283
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:33,347
Yeah, correct on both counts.

284
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,050
Buddy, you just hit
the jackpot.

285
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:37,619
This is all stuff
from my grandmother's.

286
00:18:37,752 --> 00:18:41,089
And it was passed down to her,
so it's, like, ancient-ancient.

287
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,757
Was she a believer?

288
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,191
Well, she believed
a lot of demented

289
00:18:44,324 --> 00:18:46,094
and superstitious stuff,
if that's what you mean.

290
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,595
My kind of gal.

291
00:18:47,729 --> 00:18:49,897
I've learned it's always best
to knock every piece of wood

292
00:18:50,031 --> 00:18:51,498
and throw a coin
into every fountain.

293
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,734
You just never know.

294
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,836
Well, I think you lose
a lot of coins that way.

295
00:18:54,969 --> 00:18:57,572
-That's interesting stuff.
-It sure is.

296
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,741
30 for the whole lot?

297
00:18:59,874 --> 00:19:01,809
This one's nice.

298
00:19:01,943 --> 00:19:03,143
Oh.

299
00:19:03,878 --> 00:19:04,912
Hmm.

300
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,856
Oh, the glyphs on this.

301
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:16,858
Oh, yeah. The glyph one.

302
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:18,092
You know your stuff, man.

303
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:20,094
That's the special piece
in there.

304
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,562
Actually, it's in there
by mistake.

305
00:19:21,696 --> 00:19:24,565
I can't part with it...
for less than 50 bucks.

306
00:19:25,133 --> 00:19:26,466
Mezzo-Arabic?

307
00:19:27,267 --> 00:19:29,837
Yeah. Mezzo-Arabic.

308
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:31,939
Very unique.

309
00:19:32,874 --> 00:19:34,207
Sixty.

310
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:38,546
These kinds of brass objects
were used to trap evil spirits.

311
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,882
Oh, you think there's
something inside it?

312
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,084
No clue.

313
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,852
If there is something trapped
in here,

314
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:47,187
you can bet
it's for a good reason.

315
00:19:48,022 --> 00:19:49,023
Definitely.

316
00:19:49,157 --> 00:19:51,159
I'm gonna take a PKE reading.

317
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,027
Psychokinetic energy meter.

318
00:19:53,161 --> 00:19:54,361
May I do that?

319
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:56,196
Thank you for asking.

320
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,999
So many places do that
without asking.

321
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:01,736
Oh.

322
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,805
Instant reaction.

323
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,741
Whoa. Whoa.

324
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,912
Are you above the subway line?

325
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,399
Off-the-chart
telekinetic energy!

326
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:34,267
Full-bore convective spatter!

327
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:35,803
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

328
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:37,705
I'll take the works.

329
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,306
Sorry, I don't have change.

330
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,309
Are you okay?

331
00:20:47,849 --> 00:20:50,250
Okay. Okay. Okay.

332
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,494
I'm telling you,
I mean, this...

333
00:21:01,229 --> 00:21:02,697
This wasn't here before.

334
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:05,233
It shook the whole place.

335
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,535
Has anyone ever emptied
this containment unit?

336
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,937
Where, Gary? The East River?

337
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:13,674
So you've just been stuffing
ghosts in there since 1984?

338
00:21:13,808 --> 00:21:15,342
That's the idea.

339
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:18,311
All right.
Well, maybe not the best idea.

340
00:21:18,445 --> 00:21:21,448
I'll let Winston's engineers
know about this.

341
00:21:21,582 --> 00:21:23,785
Hey, by the way,
about Winston's engineers.

342
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,553
Um, who are they?

343
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:27,255
Oh, that's not for me to say.

344
00:21:27,387 --> 00:21:28,623
No, but what are they
working on?

345
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:31,959
Is it supersecret underground
ghostbusting stuff?

346
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:35,196
That's right, Gary.

347
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:39,167
Supersecret underground
ghostbusting stuff.

348
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,535
I knew it.

349
00:21:55,783 --> 00:21:56,784
Ugh.

350
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,887
Mom!

351
00:22:01,522 --> 00:22:04,357
Mom.
There's something in the attic.

352
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:06,194
You're an adult, right?

353
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,460
Yeah.

354
00:22:07,595 --> 00:22:09,564
Then why don't you
take care of it?

355
00:22:10,198 --> 00:22:11,331
Okay.

356
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:12,867
Yeah, sure. I will.

357
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:15,468
I will take care of it.

358
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:17,839
Do that right now.

359
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,409
Ow.

360
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:37,925
You picked
the wrong house, bro.

361
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:09,690
What the actual hell?

362
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,050
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

363
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:46,459
Yeah.

364
00:23:46,594 --> 00:23:48,062
-Be safe.
-Thanks.

365
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:49,196
Where do you think
you're going?

366
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,698
You're seriously not taking me?

367
00:23:50,831 --> 00:23:53,134
-Don't look at him.
-I, uh...

368
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,335
-Gary.
-Thanks for the support.

369
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,803
-Sorry.
-What happened to you?

370
00:23:55,937 --> 00:23:57,004
It's nothing.
I can handle it.

371
00:23:57,138 --> 00:23:58,506
Did you shower,
or is that product?

372
00:23:58,639 --> 00:23:59,573
What? I'm a Ghostbuster.

373
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,042
Ha-ha. Very funny.

374
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:38,072
Boo.

375
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:42,143
Oh.

376
00:25:44,245 --> 00:25:45,312
Uh, hey.

377
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,617
You know I'm a ghost, right?

378
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,085
Kind of figured
when the chess pieces

379
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:52,720
started moving on their own.

380
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,725
And you're not...

381
00:25:58,793 --> 00:26:00,561
terrified of me?

382
00:26:01,328 --> 00:26:03,597
No. Should I be?

383
00:26:03,731 --> 00:26:04,732
I just think it's kind of weird.

384
00:26:04,865 --> 00:26:07,201
I mean, usually,
people run by now.

385
00:26:08,302 --> 00:26:10,271
I can leave if you want.

386
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:11,506
No, I'm not saying
you have to go.

387
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:12,907
If you want to, like,
float away again,

388
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,042
-I can pretend that I'm scared.
-No, I-I'm not saying...

389
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:18,813
Still weird.

390
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:24,285
Nice flames, by the way.

391
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:26,454
Thanks.

392
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:29,123
Yeah, I burned alive
in a horrifying tenement fire.

393
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,625
Guess you're lucky that
you're not all crispy.

394
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,028
I died before
my face melted off.

395
00:26:34,161 --> 00:26:35,162
That's a bonus.

396
00:26:41,335 --> 00:26:42,603
Checkmate.

397
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:46,040
What? I-I don't understand.

398
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:47,208
I-I can tell.

399
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:49,511
Hey, don't take it too hard.

400
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:52,279
I've had a lot of time
to practice.

401
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,149
So, you got a name?

402
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,250
Phoebe.

403
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:57,885
I'm Melody.

404
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:01,055
-Cool name.
-Thanks. It was a family name.

405
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:02,790
I was being sarcastic.

406
00:27:05,126 --> 00:27:06,727
I kind of like you.

407
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,401
What's the worst part
about being a ghost?

408
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:18,005
I'll be 16
for the rest of eternity.

409
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:20,841
Yikes. No matter what?

410
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:23,010
Unless I...

411
00:27:23,144 --> 00:27:25,880
Complete
my unfinished business.

412
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,258
Then what is the best part?

413
00:27:40,394 --> 00:27:41,729
Doing this.

414
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,756
Um, do you mind just...

415
00:28:09,456 --> 00:28:10,659
Yeah.

416
00:28:13,994 --> 00:28:16,063
So you're
one of Winston's guys, huh?

417
00:28:16,197 --> 00:28:18,567
-Gary.
-Hmm? Sorry.

418
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,100
Does that help you
hear the ghosts?

419
00:28:20,234 --> 00:28:23,370
Oh, what helps me listen
to the ghosts is silence.

420
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,473
Sorry.

421
00:28:34,281 --> 00:28:36,884
Okay. All right,
is something trying to get out?

422
00:28:37,586 --> 00:28:38,919
Many things.

423
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,226
Is this my dad's handwriting?

424
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:46,927
His design.

425
00:28:47,061 --> 00:28:49,797
The containment unit is
essentially a large ghost trap.

426
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,865
That was Egon Spengler's
great vision.

427
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,801
An articulated stream
of protons

428
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,970
that could stabilize
the particles of a ghost.

429
00:28:56,103 --> 00:28:58,272
-Are you following this?
-Yeah, of course I am.

430
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,874
After 40 years of compiling
spiritual waste...

431
00:29:01,008 --> 00:29:01,976
You ran out of space.

432
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,844
Well, didn't anybody
see this coming?

433
00:29:03,978 --> 00:29:05,112
It was the '80s.

434
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:08,315
Nobody was too worried
about the future.

435
00:29:08,449 --> 00:29:10,384
Then this happened.

436
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,086
This momentary burst

437
00:29:12,219 --> 00:29:14,054
of spiritual energy
created a rift.

438
00:29:15,089 --> 00:29:18,325
It's a potential gateway
to the other side.

439
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:20,494
The other side?

440
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:22,896
Are we talking about...

441
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:25,734
I don't know
what we're talking about.

442
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:27,301
That's what scares me.

443
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:32,106
Look, we didn't just buy
the firehouse for nostalgia.

444
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:35,442
This building
is the finger in the dam.

445
00:29:35,577 --> 00:29:37,144
It's the fortification between

446
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:39,913
everything we do
and don't understand.

447
00:29:40,548 --> 00:29:42,116
We have to protect it.

448
00:29:42,249 --> 00:29:44,985
O-Okay,
so the ghost compactor broke.

449
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,221
Can't you guys
just build a new one?

450
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:48,757
What-what do you mean?

451
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:50,424
What do you mean,
"what do you mean?"

452
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:52,793
Don't they know?

453
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:55,462
We already have.

454
00:29:57,766 --> 00:29:59,867
While
you've been out busting ghosts,

455
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,936
my engineers have been
thinking about our future.

456
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:08,208
Once upon a time, this was
the Triborough Aquarium.

457
00:30:08,342 --> 00:30:11,445
Most recently, it's been
more of a squatters' paradise

458
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:12,714
and rave venue.

459
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:23,692
Welcome to
the Paranormal Research Center.

460
00:30:23,824 --> 00:30:26,093
Ghostbusting asks
a lot of questions,

461
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:29,296
and now we have a place
to find the answers.

462
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,633
We have a parabotanist.

463
00:30:31,766 --> 00:30:34,368
We even have
a paramusicologist.

464
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:35,570
Hey, Lucky!

465
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:39,973
Lucky!

466
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:50,417
-Trevor?
-Hey! You're here.

467
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:55,022
Uh, when you said
you were interning,

468
00:30:55,155 --> 00:30:56,725
I didn't know you'd be
blowing stuff away with lasers.

469
00:30:56,857 --> 00:30:58,258
I know, right?
Just a little upgrade.

470
00:30:58,392 --> 00:31:00,060
Of course, you all know Lars,

471
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:02,863
our resident parabiologist.

472
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:04,465
Oh, no way.

473
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:05,734
I used to have one of these.

474
00:31:08,335 --> 00:31:09,370
Mind your fingers.

475
00:31:10,471 --> 00:31:13,407
It's possessed
by an evil Spin Doctors CD.

476
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,142
Ray Stantz has generously

477
00:31:15,275 --> 00:31:18,979
provided us with a collection
of spirit-loaded items.

478
00:31:19,113 --> 00:31:21,750
So, everything
in this place is haunted?

479
00:31:21,882 --> 00:31:23,350
Indeed.

480
00:31:23,484 --> 00:31:25,386
Look, here's a rare find.

481
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,055
This grandfather clock
is inhabited by the spirit

482
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:29,990
of an actual grandfather.

483
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:37,197
Any emotionally charged object
can contain a ghost,

484
00:31:37,331 --> 00:31:40,735
as long as it's experienced
some sort of horrific event.

485
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,369
By exciting the atoms,
we're able to create

486
00:31:42,504 --> 00:31:44,972
a fluid moment
of chemical transition.

487
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:47,876
Then we simply lock
onto the spirit...

488
00:31:49,977 --> 00:31:51,880
...extract it
from its host object...

489
00:32:07,361 --> 00:32:11,098
...and then lovingly deposit it
into our second chamber...

490
00:32:13,167 --> 00:32:16,003
...so it can be
properly disposed of.

491
00:32:21,942 --> 00:32:24,178
Have you made any attempts
on living possession?

492
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:26,480
Oh, w-we're still tweaking.

493
00:32:31,753 --> 00:32:34,121
Now, I didn't want
to show it until it was ready,

494
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:37,792
but this is what
I brought you here to see.

495
00:32:37,926 --> 00:32:40,294
Our new containment unit,

496
00:32:40,427 --> 00:32:43,230
based on Egon's
original design.

497
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:46,768
It can spin the equivalent
of 50 million cubic hectares

498
00:32:46,901 --> 00:32:48,969
of plasmic confinement.

499
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:51,506
A psychic jail as big
as the American West.

500
00:32:52,206 --> 00:32:53,708
"Home on the Strange."

501
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:56,578
Oh. Where the specters
and entities play.

502
00:32:56,711 --> 00:32:58,479
-Where the...
-Yeah.

503
00:32:58,613 --> 00:33:00,682
How long would it take
to move the ghosts

504
00:33:00,815 --> 00:33:02,015
from the firehouse to here?

505
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:04,184
If we went trap by trap
on regular shifts,

506
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:07,655
it could take anywhere between
three to seven years.

507
00:33:07,789 --> 00:33:09,524
Oh, so...
so soon-ish.

508
00:33:09,657 --> 00:33:11,058
Oh, I almost forgot.

509
00:33:11,191 --> 00:33:12,861
We don't exactly know
what it is,

510
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,495
but it broke the PKE meter.

511
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,731
Good luck extracting
whatever's inside it.

512
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:17,899
Fun.

513
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:19,433
Yeah, we're still
workshopping names.

514
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,503
Uh, I personally like
the Little Ball of Hate

515
00:33:21,636 --> 00:33:23,470
or Devil's Testicle.

516
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:25,540
Thank you, Podcast.

517
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:27,341
Yeah. You're welcome.

518
00:33:35,683 --> 00:33:37,484
What's in here?

519
00:33:37,619 --> 00:33:41,121
Wait, do you keep ghosts
just hanging out in here?

520
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:42,724
We spent a long time
trapping them.

521
00:33:42,857 --> 00:33:44,291
Now we can study them.

522
00:33:44,424 --> 00:33:46,193
Why don't they escape?

523
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,863
-Barrier of proton fields.
-Precisely.

524
00:33:48,997 --> 00:33:51,164
It's the same technology
as in your packs.

525
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:53,400
We use it
in all the enclosures.

526
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:59,874
-Oh.
-He's cute.

527
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,075
-Yeah.
-Hey, buddy.

528
00:34:06,446 --> 00:34:07,481
Now, this one is the most

529
00:34:07,615 --> 00:34:09,182
threatening pest
in the whole complex.

530
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,485
Possessor.

531
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:13,955
This spry little weasel

532
00:34:14,087 --> 00:34:17,057
can occupy any inanimate matter
it wants.

533
00:34:21,261 --> 00:34:22,664
Extremely dangerous.

534
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:41,783
Hey.

535
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:50,223
You're good.

536
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:13,014
Pheebs.
Am I doing something wrong?

537
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:14,448
It's not working.

538
00:35:14,916 --> 00:35:16,183
Can you help me?

539
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:20,454
The cyclotron isn't... cycling.

540
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:23,858
Can you help me out?

541
00:35:27,227 --> 00:35:29,697
Whoa.

542
00:35:29,831 --> 00:35:30,965
You fixed it.

543
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:32,767
Literally just unplugged.

544
00:35:35,503 --> 00:35:37,905
I know it sucks right now.
I-I do.

545
00:35:39,007 --> 00:35:41,709
But it's just temporary.
And time flies by.

546
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:43,978
I promise you. I should know.

547
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,546
Two years ago,
I was in Oklahoma,

548
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,615
and now I'm here...

549
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:49,483
with a proton pack.

550
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:52,386
I was your
science teacher, and now I'm...

551
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:57,357
Well, now I'm...

552
00:35:57,491 --> 00:36:00,061
And I'm your, um...

553
00:36:00,193 --> 00:36:02,195
We got a call downtown!

554
00:36:02,664 --> 00:36:04,197
Trev, let's go!

555
00:36:06,701 --> 00:36:07,702
Sorry.

556
00:36:36,831 --> 00:36:38,599
Hello? Anybody there?

557
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:40,568
Gh-Ghostbusters.

558
00:36:40,702 --> 00:36:42,804
Oh, good.
We need someone right away.

559
00:36:52,212 --> 00:36:53,648
All right.

560
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:55,183
We're back, baby.

561
00:36:55,315 --> 00:36:57,785
Ghostbusters are back.
Back in the big city.

562
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:59,187
Back in the Big Apple.

563
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:01,288
Gonna take a bite
out of the Big Apple.

564
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:02,890
Phoebe, Podcast.

565
00:37:03,024 --> 00:37:04,726
Podcast and Phoebe.
Can't keep us apart.

566
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,326
Dynamic duo.

567
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,762
What are we catching tonight?

568
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,124
Can't play right now.

569
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:40,528
I know you see me working.

570
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:44,464
If you're good, later on,
you'll get a tennis ball.

571
00:37:48,503 --> 00:37:50,505
Let's see
what you've got in you.

572
00:38:09,257 --> 00:38:10,691
Something wrong?

573
00:38:21,536 --> 00:38:24,105
I think it's
fighting extraction.

574
00:38:24,238 --> 00:38:25,807
Not for this long. The...

575
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:39,386
-Uh...
-Okay.

576
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,788
-Small thing.
-Uh-huh.

577
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:43,124
Need to wait for the generators
to warm back up.

578
00:38:43,257 --> 00:38:44,625
Until then...

579
00:38:46,093 --> 00:38:47,494
the proton fields are down.

580
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:51,199
Okay. Uh...

581
00:38:53,768 --> 00:38:55,136
Do you hear that?

582
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:18,092
Lars. Why haven't the ghosts
escaped yet?

583
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,773
Okay, we need to shut
that thing up.

584
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:50,524
This is the place.

585
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,392
Yeah.

586
00:39:54,362 --> 00:39:56,063
They better have baklava.

587
00:40:03,804 --> 00:40:05,039
Hi.

588
00:40:05,172 --> 00:40:06,507
You here for the ghost?

589
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:25,660
Boo.

590
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,329
Phoebe?

591
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:30,064
-Uh...
-Blast it.

592
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:31,464
"It"?

593
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,433
-Phoebe, what are you doing?
-Who's the third wheel?

594
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:35,468
Why are you just
standing there? Fire!

595
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:37,071
Uh...

596
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,675
What are you doing?!

597
00:40:40,808 --> 00:40:42,610
-You missed!
-Oh!

598
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:25,586
-If... I have great aim.
-Cool.

599
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,822
And if I wanted to hit you,
then I would've, but I didn't.

600
00:41:27,955 --> 00:41:29,390
-Right.
-If it...

601
00:41:29,523 --> 00:41:31,559
If it makes you
feel better, I guess.

602
00:41:31,692 --> 00:41:34,628
Yeah, I just feel, like,
a warm rush of relief.

603
00:41:35,796 --> 00:41:36,797
Oh.

604
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,533
Phew.

605
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,168
So...

606
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:43,571
do you want to hang out?

607
00:41:43,704 --> 00:41:45,506
You're inviting me in?

608
00:41:48,442 --> 00:41:50,644
Um, sure. Yeah.

609
00:41:50,778 --> 00:41:51,746
You're inviting me inside

610
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:54,148
your ghost extermination
headquarters?

611
00:41:54,281 --> 00:41:57,418
Uh, yeah, no, it's fine.
I see how that could be weird.

612
00:41:57,551 --> 00:41:59,320
It's cool. You don't have to...

613
00:41:59,453 --> 00:42:00,688
Nice digs.

614
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:05,192
You can transapparate?

615
00:42:05,326 --> 00:42:07,161
Oh, is that what I just did?

616
00:42:07,294 --> 00:42:08,729
Yeah, I do that.

617
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,365
How do you touch
the chess pieces if...?

618
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:12,666
Basically, I exist on

619
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,468
an entirely different
dimensional plane.

620
00:42:14,602 --> 00:42:15,603
You wouldn't get it.

621
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:17,805
I get it.
I love dimensional planes.

622
00:42:17,938 --> 00:42:20,307
I've always wanted to visit
a different dimensional plane.

623
00:42:20,441 --> 00:42:22,109
I don't know why
I said that. I...

624
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:30,051
So, like, is the rest
of this place this cool or...?

625
00:42:35,122 --> 00:42:36,624
That's our car.

626
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:38,092
And...

627
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,996
this is my locker.

628
00:42:42,129 --> 00:42:43,597
That's my name.

629
00:42:52,173 --> 00:42:54,141
Oh, uh, that's where we...

630
00:42:54,275 --> 00:42:56,077
I know what this is.

631
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:01,315
Have you ever wondered
what happens...

632
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,885
...when we're all done here?

633
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,689
I mean, I've seen it.

634
00:43:12,527 --> 00:43:14,295
Yeah, I mean, it's...

635
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:16,163
it's really beautiful,
actually.

636
00:43:16,297 --> 00:43:19,433
I mean, your particles start
to lose their bonds

637
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:22,703
and float off into space.

638
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:25,005
Then what?

639
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,807
Quantum physics suggests
that we become

640
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:28,909
a part of the fabric
of the universe.

641
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:31,445
Do you believe that?

642
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,180
I mean, I believe
in quantum physics.

643
00:43:33,314 --> 00:43:35,049
Duh.

644
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,618
Sounds cool.

645
00:43:37,751 --> 00:43:39,521
Maybe I'll be able
to check it out someday.

646
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,989
When you cross
to the other side?

647
00:43:43,057 --> 00:43:44,325
Yeah.

648
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,960
That's where my family is.

649
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,262
Why can't you join them?

650
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:51,398
If I knew,
I'd already be there.

651
00:43:57,972 --> 00:44:00,040
Is, uh, that your object?

652
00:44:00,641 --> 00:44:01,675
My what?

653
00:44:01,809 --> 00:44:03,944
It's like an emotionally
charged anchor

654
00:44:04,078 --> 00:44:06,714
that keeps us tethered
to this world.

655
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:09,483
Well, the last match burned
my family alive, so...

656
00:44:09,618 --> 00:44:12,253
Yeah, well, that'll do it.

657
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:14,054
No, it was an accident.

658
00:44:16,625 --> 00:44:17,825
-Oh, I...
-I used to think

659
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,927
these matches were
some sort of key to moving on,

660
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:24,031
but I've gotten used to the idea
that I'm not going anywhere.

661
00:44:26,066 --> 00:44:28,202
-I'm sorry.
-Pheebs?

662
00:44:30,171 --> 00:44:31,238
You okay down there?

663
00:44:31,372 --> 00:44:32,406
Um...

664
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:35,776
Uh, I'll be right up.

665
00:45:44,011 --> 00:45:45,580
I'm going as fast as I can.

666
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:51,586
Does it have to be her?

667
00:45:57,592 --> 00:45:59,193
I understand.

668
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:29,923
Hey, pal.

669
00:46:30,858 --> 00:46:32,893
Got some Cheetos for you.

670
00:46:33,027 --> 00:46:35,429
You can come on out.

671
00:46:35,563 --> 00:46:38,032
I'm only gonna shoot you
in the face.

672
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:41,902
Come on.

673
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:07,595
That's it.

674
00:47:10,665 --> 00:47:12,466
Huh? The hell?

675
00:47:18,005 --> 00:47:19,239
Phoebe?

676
00:47:19,373 --> 00:47:20,709
-You okay?
-Yeah.

677
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:22,309
Basement. Now.

678
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:36,957
Can you explain this?

679
00:47:39,728 --> 00:47:41,161
No, I can't.

680
00:47:52,439 --> 00:47:54,308
-Cool.
-Empirically.

681
00:47:54,441 --> 00:47:57,945
Approaching the mythically cold
temperature of absolute zero,

682
00:47:58,078 --> 00:48:00,582
the degree at which
all particles stop.

683
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:02,216
Zero kelvin.

684
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:05,553
The suspension of life itself.
Exquisite.

685
00:48:05,687 --> 00:48:07,187
If you like that...

686
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:10,525
you're gonna love this.

687
00:48:18,365 --> 00:48:20,735
Ever since you brought in
this lethal snow cone,

688
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:23,036
the other ghosts have been
acting peculiar.

689
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:24,739
We think it's communicating.

690
00:48:24,873 --> 00:48:26,073
So the orb's kind of chatty?

691
00:48:26,206 --> 00:48:28,242
Not the orb itself
but whatever lies within it.

692
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:29,878
We think it's commanding
the other ghosts

693
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,479
with some sort of mind control.

694
00:48:37,017 --> 00:48:38,553
All right.

695
00:48:54,468 --> 00:48:55,502
-Wow.
-Oh.

696
00:48:55,637 --> 00:48:57,971
Extreme thermodynamic
"exutions,"

697
00:48:58,105 --> 00:48:59,406
thought transference...

698
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:01,275
This little cutie gets out,

699
00:49:01,408 --> 00:49:03,477
no telling how dangerous
it could be.

700
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:09,950
Where the hell did you guys
get this thing?

701
00:49:22,996 --> 00:49:24,699
Hey, man.

702
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:28,202
-Hey.
-Are you Nadeem Razmaadi?

703
00:49:29,303 --> 00:49:30,304
Maybe.

704
00:49:30,437 --> 00:49:31,940
Did you recently sell
a collection

705
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:34,408
of family artifacts
to Ray Stantz?

706
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:38,312
-That money's gone.
-Wait.

707
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:43,183
Uh, we're not looking
for a refund. We...

708
00:49:43,317 --> 00:49:44,819
Come on in.

709
00:49:44,953 --> 00:49:46,453
I got a bunch of other stuff
for sale.

710
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:50,157
I am a licensed third-party
reseller of sneakers.

711
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,226
-What's your shoe size, my man?
-Uh, ten.

712
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:54,529
I don't have any tens.
Can you squeeze into an eight?

713
00:49:54,662 --> 00:49:57,130
-No, probably not.
-Is this your bachelor pad?

714
00:49:57,264 --> 00:50:00,334
This was my dadi's place--
my grandmother's.

715
00:50:00,467 --> 00:50:01,468
Hmm.

716
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,103
Nipple stuff.

717
00:50:03,237 --> 00:50:04,973
-Iconic.
-Oh, yeah.

718
00:50:05,105 --> 00:50:06,508
That was my dadi's
favorite painting.

719
00:50:06,641 --> 00:50:09,076
I can't really part with it.
What's your offer?

720
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:11,144
What was
your grandmother's deal?

721
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:14,081
We weren't really that close.
She said I was unambitious.

722
00:50:14,214 --> 00:50:15,482
But, really,
who's the brave one, huh?

723
00:50:15,617 --> 00:50:17,084
The brother who goes
to engineering school

724
00:50:17,217 --> 00:50:18,352
or the one who forges ahead

725
00:50:18,485 --> 00:50:21,054
with no education
or future prospects?

726
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:22,924
The second one.

727
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,526
-Right? Yeah.
-Yes. Absolutely.

728
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:25,793
Yeah, I think that all the time.

729
00:50:25,927 --> 00:50:26,694
Yep. Me, too. I also think
that all the time.

730
00:50:26,828 --> 00:50:27,996
Hundred percent. It's heroic.

731
00:50:28,128 --> 00:50:29,764
Yeah, we're curious about
a particular object.

732
00:50:29,898 --> 00:50:31,298
Brass orb.

733
00:50:31,833 --> 00:50:33,166
Hurts when touched.

734
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,036
Oh, yeah, that came from my
grandmother's special back room

735
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:38,673
where she keeps
all the really good stuff.

736
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:42,075
But I'm not supposed to take
anybody back there, so...

737
00:50:51,485 --> 00:50:52,486
Whoa.

738
00:50:53,821 --> 00:50:55,055
Nice sex dungeon.

739
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:57,424
-Okay, dadi.
-Not a sex dungeon.

740
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,126
Would a sex dungeon
have these chains?

741
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:00,360
-Yeah, definitely.
-Yeah.

742
00:51:00,494 --> 00:51:02,496
As soon as I said it,
I realized it would.

743
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:06,034
Seriously,
what'd she do in here?

744
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,002
I don't know. I found
this room after she died

745
00:51:08,135 --> 00:51:10,103
while I was looking
for some Pop-Tarts.

746
00:51:12,574 --> 00:51:15,309
All this stuff is for sale, too,
by the way.

747
00:51:16,611 --> 00:51:19,346
-Is this brass or copper, Lars?
-Brass.

748
00:51:19,479 --> 00:51:21,481
Once believed to be
a magical alloy.

749
00:51:21,616 --> 00:51:22,650
There are countless tales

750
00:51:22,784 --> 00:51:24,451
of demons trapped
in brass urns and lamps,

751
00:51:24,586 --> 00:51:26,621
going all the way back
to the time of Solomon.

752
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:29,624
Sick outfit.

753
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,262
Whoa. You guys hear that?

754
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:37,230
No echo, no anything.

755
00:51:37,364 --> 00:51:39,199
It's like... it's like
a dead room in here.

756
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,835
So she could be as loud
as she wanted.

757
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:42,102
Please stop.

758
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:43,270
Please stop making sex jokes

759
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,673
about my recently deceased
grandmother.

760
00:51:45,807 --> 00:51:48,910
The brass orb--
it was always kept in here?

761
00:51:49,043 --> 00:51:50,545
Far as I know.

762
00:51:50,678 --> 00:51:52,880
Is it possible she wanted
to keep it quiet?

763
00:51:58,352 --> 00:51:59,687
What does that mean?

764
00:52:01,288 --> 00:52:02,790
It means you're coming with us.

765
00:52:03,992 --> 00:52:05,526
Dr. Ray?

766
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,595
-Yes, Phoebe?
-I think that somebody left

767
00:52:07,729 --> 00:52:10,598
a rotting carrot
on one of your shelves.

768
00:52:10,732 --> 00:52:11,666
Oh, that's a human pinkie.

769
00:52:11,799 --> 00:52:13,101
Picked that up

770
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:15,135
at the old State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane

771
00:52:15,268 --> 00:52:17,872
in Pennsylvania-- haunted.

772
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,406
And we had no equipment
back then.

773
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,708
-Um...
-We...

774
00:52:20,842 --> 00:52:24,211
Actually, I had a question
I wanted to ask you.

775
00:52:26,246 --> 00:52:28,315
Have you ever...

776
00:52:28,448 --> 00:52:30,818
wondered what it would be like
to be a ghost?

777
00:52:33,855 --> 00:52:35,790
Every day of my life, dear.

778
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:38,325
-Really?
-Sure.

779
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:41,361
I mean,
how I would materialize.

780
00:52:42,063 --> 00:52:43,263
What's that feel like?

781
00:52:43,397 --> 00:52:45,633
Would it be some kind
of a visual manifestation?

782
00:52:45,767 --> 00:52:48,803
I mean, if something's...

783
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:50,672
What is that?

784
00:52:50,805 --> 00:52:54,408
Oh, um, I was just watching
a video I shot of the orb.

785
00:52:54,542 --> 00:52:56,077
I think the audio's
corrupted or something.

786
00:52:56,209 --> 00:52:58,245
It's all weird. Here.

787
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,081
Check it out.

788
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:04,786
Ancient verbiage, um...

789
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:06,521
Yeah, but what language?

790
00:53:06,654 --> 00:53:07,755
A dead one.

791
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,258
I know a guy who could help us.

792
00:53:11,826 --> 00:53:13,193
But...

793
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,365
Should we investigate?

794
00:53:18,933 --> 00:53:20,568
Mm, we could.

795
00:53:21,301 --> 00:53:22,770
Aren't you benched?

796
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:24,605
Aren't you retired?

797
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:27,575
Oh.
You gonna take that from her?

798
00:53:46,426 --> 00:53:47,729
Hold still.

799
00:53:52,332 --> 00:53:53,935
What's this?

800
00:53:54,068 --> 00:53:56,303
It's just
a garden-variety test:

801
00:53:56,436 --> 00:53:59,107
Are you... a human?

802
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,775
You should be able
to pass it easily

803
00:54:00,908 --> 00:54:05,847
unless you are possessed
by a cross-dimensional beast.

804
00:54:07,115 --> 00:54:09,517
Right, just a couple human
beings having a conversation.

805
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,553
One of them has a pasta pot
strapped to his head.

806
00:54:12,687 --> 00:54:15,355
Let's start off
with a layup, okay?

807
00:54:17,692 --> 00:54:18,760
Puppies.

808
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:22,395
Love them or kill them?

809
00:54:27,702 --> 00:54:28,936
I love them?

810
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:32,807
That's one correct.

811
00:54:34,642 --> 00:54:36,309
Okay. Great.

812
00:54:36,443 --> 00:54:38,613
Yes, but that was very easy.

813
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,618
Have you ever experienced
déjà vu?

814
00:54:44,519 --> 00:54:45,520
No.

815
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,821
Okay.

816
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:49,257
Have you ever experienced...

817
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,792
Déjà vu?

818
00:54:52,392 --> 00:54:54,494
That's pretty good.

819
00:54:57,364 --> 00:54:59,033
Ow!

820
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,935
What was that?

821
00:55:02,837 --> 00:55:05,239
Don't throw any more pens
at me, dude.

822
00:55:05,372 --> 00:55:07,074
That made you angry, did it?

823
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,877
Yeah, it made me angry, did it.

824
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:15,716
Hypothetical: You're about
to devour a small child.

825
00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:19,687
Would you prefer skin on
or skinless?

826
00:55:22,455 --> 00:55:23,658
Okay. I'm not...

827
00:55:23,791 --> 00:55:25,458
This interview is over.
I'm not gonna answer that.

828
00:55:25,593 --> 00:55:27,962
-Refuse to answer that? Okay.
-No, no, no. I'm not refusing.

829
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:31,065
Okay. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Is it a human child?

830
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:32,465
Are there other kinds
of children?

831
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,935
Are you thinking
of a specific child?

832
00:55:34,068 --> 00:55:35,303
Is this child related to me?

833
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:37,538
-Would that be necessary?
-No, it's not necessary.

834
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:38,906
You're the one
who brought it up.

835
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,440
I don't want to eat any...

836
00:55:40,575 --> 00:55:42,342
I told you to stop

837
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:43,611
throwing pens at me.

838
00:55:43,744 --> 00:55:45,913
I'm sorry. It's a perfectly
normal reaction!

839
00:55:46,047 --> 00:55:47,982
Oh, oh! Don't! Okay! Okay!

840
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:53,420
What are you staring at?!

841
00:56:00,094 --> 00:56:01,162
Did I pass?

842
00:56:15,776 --> 00:56:19,379
Dr. Stantz, I don't think that
this is a legal parking space.

843
00:56:19,513 --> 00:56:21,414
Ah, they know me here.

844
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:22,783
Did you know
these two regal kittens

845
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:24,185
actually have names?

846
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:26,187
You have Patience
and Fortitude.

847
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,822
Ah, no! Dr. Stantz!

848
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:29,790
No, you are forbidden
from coming within

849
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:31,626
50 feet of this library.

850
00:56:31,759 --> 00:56:33,961
Good to see you, buddy.
Been a long time, huh?

851
00:56:34,595 --> 00:56:35,596
Hi.

852
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,031
Excuse us.

853
00:56:40,334 --> 00:56:42,803
It's not Essenic.
It's not Chaldean.

854
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:44,805
It ain't French.

855
00:56:46,007 --> 00:56:49,343
This is pre-Sumerian.
This is pre-Sanskrit.

856
00:56:49,476 --> 00:56:50,745
Well, what does it mean?

857
00:56:50,878 --> 00:56:53,446
Five people in the world
can understand these words.

858
00:56:53,581 --> 00:56:57,484
Whi... which means
my colleague Dr. Jahangiri

859
00:56:57,618 --> 00:56:59,153
put you up to this.

860
00:57:01,088 --> 00:57:03,090
Jahangiri's already dead.

861
00:57:03,224 --> 00:57:05,393
-What?!
-No. Your colleague's...

862
00:57:05,526 --> 00:57:07,395
-Your colleague's fine.
-Sorry.

863
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:09,931
What the fudge
is wrong with you?

864
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:13,534
Listen, this language has been
dead for thousands of years.

865
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:15,603
How did you get this recording?

866
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:18,539
Do you believe
in spiritual inhabitation?

867
00:57:19,273 --> 00:57:20,841
Spectral possession?

868
00:57:20,975 --> 00:57:23,544
Look, there's a reason
I'm down here in the basement.

869
00:57:23,678 --> 00:57:26,247
I'm the library folklorist.
I'm also the tristate treasurer

870
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,015
of the H.P. Lovecraft Society,
so...

871
00:57:28,149 --> 00:57:30,384
Do I believe in spirits?
Yes, I believe in spirits.

872
00:57:30,518 --> 00:57:32,253
I believe
in self-winding clocks

873
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:34,288
and the singing cheeses
of Copenhagen.

874
00:57:34,422 --> 00:57:35,823
Please continue.

875
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:38,491
All right.
The ancient chants you heard

876
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:40,828
came from
this mysterious object.

877
00:57:40,962 --> 00:57:42,797
It's about the size
of a boccie ball.

878
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:46,901
Come with me to the library.

879
00:57:47,034 --> 00:57:49,537
Are we not in the library?

880
00:57:50,171 --> 00:57:51,272
Upstairs is just for show.

881
00:57:51,405 --> 00:57:53,507
Gilded research rooms
where struggling actors

882
00:57:53,641 --> 00:57:56,210
can Twitch-stream
and buy crypto.

883
00:57:56,344 --> 00:57:59,080
The old library is below.

884
00:58:04,785 --> 00:58:07,521
-Welcome to the old library.
-Whoa.

885
00:58:09,290 --> 00:58:11,692
That object of yours--

886
00:58:12,893 --> 00:58:16,664
its last recorded sighting...

887
00:58:18,532 --> 00:58:22,036
...wasn't photographed,
and it wasn't painted.

888
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:27,208
It was carved in stone.

889
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:29,276
Whoa.

890
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:32,947
Recognize anything?

891
00:58:33,514 --> 00:58:35,049
There's your orb.

892
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:36,684
What is it?

893
00:58:36,817 --> 00:58:39,820
Well, the better question is:
What's inside of it?

894
00:58:40,654 --> 00:58:41,689
What's inside of it?

895
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:44,392
Excellent question.
Probably sand.

896
00:58:44,558 --> 00:58:46,560
But if you believe
the folklore--

897
00:58:46,694 --> 00:58:49,096
and I always believe
the folklore--

898
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,666
that orb is a magical prison

899
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:56,103
for a phantom god
called Garraka.

900
00:58:58,372 --> 00:59:00,441
See, 4,000 years ago,

901
00:59:00,574 --> 00:59:03,310
Garraka served
a bloodthirsty king

902
00:59:03,444 --> 00:59:04,945
called Samudari.

903
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:07,014
You know, from the Battle
of the Seven Armies,

904
00:59:07,148 --> 00:59:08,949
et cetera, et cetera.

905
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:11,986
After Garraka helped conquer
half of Central Asia,

906
00:59:12,119 --> 00:59:15,956
the king grew suspicious
of his ambitions.

907
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,994
Garraka was captured, branded,
broken and disfigured.

908
00:59:20,127 --> 00:59:22,430
His horns, the source
of his greatest strength,

909
00:59:22,563 --> 00:59:24,698
were, like, ripped
off his head.

910
00:59:24,832 --> 00:59:26,267
Nasty stuff.

911
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,802
I love it. No notes.

912
00:59:27,935 --> 00:59:29,837
But Garraka didn't take
too kindly to that

913
00:59:29,970 --> 00:59:33,508
and went on a bit
of a murder bender.

914
00:59:33,641 --> 00:59:37,078
His plan was to raise an army
of the undead

915
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:42,283
and wage war on humanity by
channeling fear into a weapon.

916
00:59:44,985 --> 00:59:46,353
Kusharit Umoti.

917
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:49,190
The Death Chill.

918
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:52,359
The power to kill
by fear itself.

919
00:59:52,493 --> 00:59:54,829
A cold shiver runs
down your spine.

920
00:59:55,596 --> 00:59:57,932
Your veins turn
to rivers of ice.

921
00:59:58,732 --> 01:00:00,267
Your bones crack.

922
01:00:00,401 --> 01:00:02,103
Your lungs cave.

923
01:00:02,236 --> 01:00:03,904
And the last thing you see

924
01:00:04,872 --> 01:00:08,175
is your own tear ducts
freezing up.

925
01:00:11,245 --> 01:00:12,646
It's so cool.

926
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,849
Anyhoo, before Garraka
could collapse

927
01:00:14,982 --> 01:00:19,253
the collective bronchial tubes
of greater South Asia,

928
01:00:19,386 --> 01:00:21,655
he finally met his match.

929
01:00:21,789 --> 01:00:24,725
His icy spell was shattered
by a roving band

930
01:00:24,859 --> 01:00:29,531
of mythical spirit catchers
called the Firemasters,

931
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:30,931
who used fire and brass

932
01:00:31,065 --> 01:00:35,136
to trap the evil god
inside of an orb.

933
01:00:35,269 --> 01:00:38,839
The very orb you now possess.

934
01:00:41,576 --> 01:00:43,177
Kind of like Ghostbusters.

935
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:44,979
Yeah.

936
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:50,050
If you're willing to entertain
a little historical gossip...

937
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,723
These are wax cylinders.

938
01:00:55,856 --> 01:00:57,559
19th-century audio recordings.

939
01:00:57,725 --> 01:01:00,327
Our collection is bonkers.
Here.

940
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:03,230
Mary Todd Lincoln
using the f-word.

941
01:01:03,364 --> 01:01:04,798
Apparently, she saw a moth.

942
01:01:04,932 --> 01:01:09,737
But the one I think you'll be
most interested in is...

943
01:01:10,304 --> 01:01:11,506
this one.

944
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:15,577
See, back in the Gilded Age
of our fair metropolis,

945
01:01:15,709 --> 01:01:17,646
there was this group
of rich assholes called

946
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:21,148
the Manhattan
Adventurers Society.

947
01:01:21,282 --> 01:01:23,117
They would steal relics
and artifacts.

948
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,318
They'd get together.

949
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:26,387
They'd enjoy them
with their Beaujolais

950
01:01:26,521 --> 01:01:27,589
and a couple of hookers.

951
01:01:27,721 --> 01:01:30,659
Real colonial loot fest
kind of stuff.

952
01:01:30,791 --> 01:01:32,760
Anyway, one night,
they took out

953
01:01:32,893 --> 01:01:37,464
a particularly rare relic,
the Orb of Garraka.

954
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,202
And then they played
this chant,

955
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:44,205
which opened the orb.

956
01:01:46,207 --> 01:01:49,644
For the first time
in New York history,

957
01:01:49,777 --> 01:01:53,747
a room full of people
froze to death

958
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:56,150
in the middle of July.

959
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:16,705
Uh...

960
01:02:16,837 --> 01:02:18,573
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

961
01:02:27,314 --> 01:02:28,415
It's the Possessor!

962
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,484
He's got the chant! Stop him!

963
01:02:35,523 --> 01:02:37,024
Stop that bag!

964
01:02:37,157 --> 01:02:38,826
-Excuse us!
-Wh-- Hey!

965
01:02:38,959 --> 01:02:40,794
-Move, move, move!
-No running!

966
01:02:45,232 --> 01:02:46,400
Go left!

967
01:02:46,534 --> 01:02:48,168
Get it!
Keep your eyes on it!

968
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:52,239
Shh.

969
01:03:12,493 --> 01:03:13,861
Excuse me.

970
01:03:30,044 --> 01:03:31,812
What the hell was that?

971
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:32,946
Oh, Possessor ghost.

972
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:34,749
Master of concealment
and disguise.

973
01:03:34,882 --> 01:03:36,518
Now it'll be
impossible to find.

974
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:38,052
Oh, oh, there it is.

975
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:40,988
Well, that's a close one.

976
01:03:42,089 --> 01:03:44,058
You don't want that
getting away.

977
01:03:44,191 --> 01:03:45,760
-Give me a boost, will you?
-Oh, yeah. Okay.

978
01:03:45,893 --> 01:03:47,361
I got you.

979
01:03:49,531 --> 01:03:51,031
Oh, my God.

980
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:06,715
Dr. Ray!

981
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:08,415
The bike! Push the button!

982
01:04:10,819 --> 01:04:12,119
Uh...

983
01:04:13,555 --> 01:04:15,590
-Press the button!
-There's too many buttons!

984
01:04:21,061 --> 01:04:23,163
Oh!

985
01:04:27,702 --> 01:04:28,770
Come on!

986
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:32,940
Yes!

987
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:46,387
-Podcast, do something!
-I-I'm trying!

988
01:04:46,521 --> 01:04:47,722
Come on!

989
01:04:47,856 --> 01:04:50,424
-Hurry up! Push the button!
-I'm trying...

990
01:05:03,738 --> 01:05:05,640
Hands where we can see 'em!

991
01:05:05,774 --> 01:05:08,108
Step forward.

992
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,010
The lions, Phoebe.

993
01:05:10,144 --> 01:05:12,680
They're iconic.
People love them.

994
01:05:12,814 --> 01:05:15,617
They make kids want
to visit the library.

995
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:17,652
Do you know how hard it is

996
01:05:17,786 --> 01:05:19,721
to get kids to visit
the library?

997
01:05:19,854 --> 01:05:21,355
I love the library.

998
01:05:21,488 --> 01:05:23,558
Then why did you shoot
Fortitude in the face?

999
01:05:23,691 --> 01:05:24,626
I was doing my job.

1000
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:26,126
You don't have a job!

1001
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,162
Magnifique!

1002
01:05:28,295 --> 01:05:30,431
My compliments to the chef.

1003
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:34,736
As far as fiascos go,
this was just dynamite.

1004
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:36,236
One would think, though,

1005
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,473
you'd have a little more respect
for the public library,

1006
01:05:39,607 --> 01:05:40,941
you being such a bookworm.

1007
01:05:41,074 --> 01:05:43,645
-Why don't you just back off.
-I just want to thank her.

1008
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:45,780
For what?

1009
01:05:45,914 --> 01:05:48,516
For 40 years, I've been waiting
to say these words.

1010
01:05:49,651 --> 01:05:52,821
The Ghostbusters are finished.

1011
01:05:52,953 --> 01:05:54,823
Your firehouse
has been condemned.

1012
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:56,190
Your packs are
in a police lockup.

1013
01:05:56,323 --> 01:05:58,258
They'll be melted down
for scrap by morning.

1014
01:05:58,392 --> 01:06:00,562
And just wait until
I get ahold of your car.

1015
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:01,696
Now, just hold on here...

1016
01:06:01,830 --> 01:06:03,096
The last time you tried
to shut us down,

1017
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,733
you created a crossrip
into another dimension.

1018
01:06:05,867 --> 01:06:06,801
Watch out, kiddo.

1019
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:08,903
That sounds a lot like slander.

1020
01:06:09,036 --> 01:06:11,873
That's a crime punishable
with time in prison.

1021
01:06:12,005 --> 01:06:14,041
So let me ask you,
Miss Spengler,

1022
01:06:14,174 --> 01:06:16,009
are you going to behave,

1023
01:06:16,977 --> 01:06:19,079
or do I need
to have you arrested?

1024
01:06:32,493 --> 01:06:36,296
Well, we really thought
you were gonna choose "behave."

1025
01:06:37,397 --> 01:06:38,666
Sure, I get it. You're upset.

1026
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:39,734
Can we just get to the part

1027
01:06:39,868 --> 01:06:40,835
where you ground me
and move on?

1028
01:06:40,969 --> 01:06:43,303
Oh, you're not grounded.
You're fired.

1029
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:47,241
Honestly,
if you weren't a Spengler,

1030
01:06:47,374 --> 01:06:48,977
you'd be answering our phones.

1031
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:51,679
-Excuse me?
-Don't talk to her like that.

1032
01:06:52,514 --> 01:06:53,515
Are you serious?

1033
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:55,048
I'm very serious.

1034
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:56,951
She's your mom.

1035
01:06:57,084 --> 01:06:58,686
Being a Spengler
doesn't make you a genius.

1036
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:00,153
It just makes you
part of this family.

1037
01:07:00,287 --> 01:07:01,689
Are you even a part
of this family?

1038
01:07:01,823 --> 01:07:03,390
-Phoebe.
-It's...

1039
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:07,160
Yeah. I get it. Fair enough.

1040
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:08,963
But maybe if you weren't
being so selfish,

1041
01:07:09,096 --> 01:07:10,532
you might notice that your mom,

1042
01:07:10,665 --> 01:07:12,266
your brother and I
have been doing everything

1043
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:15,235
to try and protect you,
so wake up!

1044
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:24,311
Sucks, doesn't it?

1045
01:07:24,444 --> 01:07:25,580
What the
hell were you thinking?

1046
01:07:25,713 --> 01:07:26,881
You don't get it.
There was a wax cylinder.

1047
01:07:27,015 --> 01:07:28,081
-There was chanting.
-You do realize what kind

1048
01:07:28,215 --> 01:07:29,349
of trouble you've gotten
yourself into today?

1049
01:07:29,483 --> 01:07:30,718
The gramophone handle
was turning by its...

1050
01:07:30,852 --> 01:07:31,986
Ray, shut up!

1051
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:34,254
Shut up. Ray.

1052
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:36,390
Geez.

1053
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,526
We're too old for this.

1054
01:07:40,028 --> 01:07:41,194
Zedd, I...

1055
01:07:41,328 --> 01:07:43,765
I don't know what our age
has to do with this.

1056
01:07:43,898 --> 01:07:45,533
There was, uh, chanting
coming out of that cylinder.

1057
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,035
-Ray.
-It's a trigger.

1058
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:50,070
-It's a catalyst. It's a key.
-You could've got yourself hurt.

1059
01:07:50,203 --> 01:07:53,173
You could've got
those kids hurt.

1060
01:07:54,274 --> 01:07:56,076
Geez, Ray.

1061
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:57,912
Take a vacation, okay?

1062
01:07:58,046 --> 01:07:59,547
Go visit some old ruins
or something.

1063
01:07:59,681 --> 01:08:01,348
I don't know, sit your ass
on a beach somewhere.

1064
01:08:01,481 --> 01:08:03,283
A little color
wouldn't kill you.

1065
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:08,488
Ray, this is supposed to be
our golden years.

1066
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:11,124
Winston...

1067
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:14,596
this is the way I want
to spend my golden years.

1068
01:08:16,064 --> 01:08:17,565
This is what I love.

1069
01:08:18,032 --> 01:08:20,334
I know. I know.

1070
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,169
Me, too.

1071
01:08:22,302 --> 01:08:25,707
But you need to find a new way
to do the things you love

1072
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,341
before it kills you.

1073
01:08:42,724 --> 01:08:43,725
Pheebs.

1074
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:53,768
Oh, man.

1075
01:08:56,771 --> 01:08:58,138
They stole our gear.

1076
01:08:58,271 --> 01:09:01,976
"Civil forfeiture," I believe,
is the terminology.

1077
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:04,846
-Stop it! Fire pole?
-Oh, yeah.

1078
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:05,947
You really got to try
that thing, dude.

1079
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,180
Who is he?

1080
01:09:07,314 --> 01:09:08,783
Oh, I'm Nadeem.
I'm a potential deep well

1081
01:09:08,916 --> 01:09:12,152
of psychokinetic energy
and quite possibly possessed.

1082
01:09:12,285 --> 01:09:13,755
Can I try the fire pole?

1083
01:09:14,922 --> 01:09:16,724
Yeah. Knock your socks off.

1084
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,728
Is this the last night
in the firehouse?

1085
01:09:22,162 --> 01:09:23,363
I don't know.

1086
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:29,904
Hey.

1087
01:09:31,706 --> 01:09:32,907
So this is it, huh?

1088
01:09:34,542 --> 01:09:37,210
I'm used to being on the move.
I'm good at it.

1089
01:09:39,814 --> 01:09:40,815
I don't know.

1090
01:09:41,816 --> 01:09:45,053
I'd kind of like to stay
and fight for this place.

1091
01:09:45,185 --> 01:09:46,386
It's not our place.

1092
01:09:46,988 --> 01:09:48,188
Of course it is.

1093
01:09:49,356 --> 01:09:50,658
We can't leave.

1094
01:09:51,659 --> 01:09:52,860
I mean...

1095
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:57,899
If there's something strange
in the neighborhood...

1096
01:09:59,834 --> 01:10:01,769
...who are they gonna call?

1097
01:10:01,903 --> 01:10:05,807
If there's something weird
and it don't look good...

1098
01:10:07,842 --> 01:10:10,178
-...who-who you gonna call?
-Ghostbusters.

1099
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:12,146
What? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what was that?

1100
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:14,515
-Ghostbusters.
-Ghostbusters.

1101
01:10:15,516 --> 01:10:17,618
This is the home
of the Ghostbusters.

1102
01:10:18,285 --> 01:10:19,754
We're the Ghostbusters.

1103
01:10:21,956 --> 01:10:23,223
Can I tell you something else?

1104
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:24,759
It's important.

1105
01:10:25,526 --> 01:10:26,493
What?

1106
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:28,963
-Busting makes me feel good.
-No.

1107
01:10:29,097 --> 01:10:30,998
-No. Get out.
-It makes...

1108
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:37,437
Holy crap!
This place is trashed.

1109
01:10:37,572 --> 01:10:39,507
I'm trying to get
a reading in here, please.

1110
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:41,142
-What happened here?
-Okay, look...

1111
01:10:41,274 --> 01:10:43,044
Such a disaster.
What have you done?

1112
01:10:43,177 --> 01:10:44,779
This is a very sensitive area.

1113
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:46,114
Oh, it is freezing.

1114
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:47,548
Yeah, well,
maybe it wouldn't be freezing

1115
01:10:47,682 --> 01:10:49,751
if a certain someone
had left his grandmother's orb

1116
01:10:49,884 --> 01:10:51,219
in her room where it belongs.

1117
01:10:51,886 --> 01:10:53,554
Wait, I'm confused.

1118
01:10:53,688 --> 01:10:56,057
You're saying this is my fault?

1119
01:10:56,190 --> 01:10:57,625
Here's the deal.

1120
01:10:57,759 --> 01:10:59,961
Your grandmother was
guardian of the orb,

1121
01:11:00,094 --> 01:11:02,864
the last line of defense
against Garraka.

1122
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:04,331
Now it's your turn.

1123
01:11:04,464 --> 01:11:06,167
You are the Firemaster.

1124
01:11:06,299 --> 01:11:08,268
Ooh, that's dramatic.
I like that.

1125
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:10,004
It's not a joke, man.

1126
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:11,438
For thousands of years,
your family

1127
01:11:11,572 --> 01:11:13,141
has selflessly guarded
the world

1128
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:15,009
from an unimaginable evil.

1129
01:11:15,143 --> 01:11:16,511
Now, either she didn't
tell you about it

1130
01:11:16,644 --> 01:11:18,980
-or you weren't listening.
-Could've been either.

1131
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:20,915
We had
a complicated relationship.

1132
01:11:21,048 --> 01:11:22,482
Instead, you come into my shop,

1133
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:25,285
try to sell your heritage--
your birthright-- for 50 bucks.

1134
01:11:25,418 --> 01:11:27,155
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

1135
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:28,421
Who are you? Who's that?

1136
01:11:28,556 --> 01:11:30,457
You are the Firemaster.

1137
01:11:31,559 --> 01:11:33,795
It's time for you
to claim your destiny, son.

1138
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:44,404
Light the candle.

1139
01:11:45,372 --> 01:11:47,008
I think we both know
that's impossible.

1140
01:11:47,141 --> 01:11:50,477
Son, I stopped believing
in that word a long time ago.

1141
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:52,814
What if you were
humanity's last hope?

1142
01:11:52,947 --> 01:11:54,816
Dude, I've never been
anyone's only hope.

1143
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:57,518
I went to senior prom as
a backup for someone's brother.

1144
01:11:57,652 --> 01:11:59,220
You may not choose
to believe it,

1145
01:11:59,352 --> 01:12:01,022
but there are many stories
of people

1146
01:12:01,155 --> 01:12:04,192
with inexplicable gifts,
going back eons.

1147
01:12:04,324 --> 01:12:07,261
The strength of Samson,
the speed of Achilles.

1148
01:12:07,394 --> 01:12:09,964
Perfect pitch, sick dance moves.

1149
01:12:10,097 --> 01:12:11,532
Even pyrokinesis.

1150
01:12:12,033 --> 01:12:13,034
So...

1151
01:12:14,101 --> 01:12:15,402
light the candle.

1152
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:18,573
Light the candle?

1153
01:12:19,240 --> 01:12:20,608
Just like that?

1154
01:12:20,741 --> 01:12:22,409
I just do that...

1155
01:12:26,781 --> 01:12:28,015
What?

1156
01:12:38,793 --> 01:12:40,294
Oh.

1157
01:12:40,427 --> 01:12:43,231
Indus literature speaks
of a sacred fire,

1158
01:12:43,363 --> 01:12:44,397
a smokeless flame,

1159
01:12:44,532 --> 01:12:46,601
like the kind Moses saw
on Mount Horeb

1160
01:12:46,734 --> 01:12:48,669
when he encountered
the burning bush.

1161
01:12:48,803 --> 01:12:50,905
Like the kind the demon djinn
brought forth

1162
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:52,173
from the seven earths,

1163
01:12:52,306 --> 01:12:54,374
that flowed through the hair
of Sambo-Kojin,

1164
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:56,409
the Japanese god of the hearth.

1165
01:12:56,544 --> 01:13:00,380
That same sacred power exists
in your fingertips.

1166
01:13:01,414 --> 01:13:02,884
Wow.

1167
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:05,086
Oh.

1168
01:13:06,854 --> 01:13:08,388
Light the candle.

1169
01:13:10,625 --> 01:13:12,425
It's his first time.

1170
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:14,629
I think we're all going to die.

1171
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:22,136
Phoebe?

1172
01:13:23,971 --> 01:13:25,506
Um, can I come in?

1173
01:13:30,378 --> 01:13:31,478
I just wanted to talk to you

1174
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:33,547
about what happened
at the police station.

1175
01:13:34,548 --> 01:13:37,450
Uh, because I-I know
that was rough.

1176
01:13:38,386 --> 01:13:40,154
And, um...

1177
01:13:40,288 --> 01:13:41,389
but, you know, you know,
life is rough.

1178
01:13:41,522 --> 01:13:44,625
L-Life is unpredictable
and crazy and...

1179
01:13:47,561 --> 01:13:50,531
Doors close. Friends change.

1180
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:55,603
But, uh... but family is...

1181
01:13:56,938 --> 01:13:59,140
...is the one thing
that's there no matter what.

1182
01:14:00,374 --> 01:14:03,476
You know, uh...

1183
01:14:03,611 --> 01:14:05,880
Sometimes they're not even
your actual blood relatives.

1184
01:14:06,013 --> 01:14:07,048
They're just...

1185
01:14:08,416 --> 01:14:09,951
They're the people
that remind you

1186
01:14:10,084 --> 01:14:11,185
you have a home.

1187
01:14:15,556 --> 01:14:18,526
Anyway, I think you're great.

1188
01:14:21,262 --> 01:14:22,663
I think you're really great.

1189
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:27,234
I'm really glad
we had this talk.

1190
01:14:29,103 --> 01:14:31,005
I don't know, every time I do
what I think is right,

1191
01:14:31,138 --> 01:14:34,442
they just come down on me like
I'm screwing everything up.

1192
01:14:34,575 --> 01:14:36,243
-That's ridiculous.
-I know.

1193
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:41,515
What?

1194
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:44,151
Just sucks that the only person
who gets me is...

1195
01:14:45,252 --> 01:14:47,021
a ghost.

1196
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:50,624
Yeah. It's too bad we exist on
different dimensional planes.

1197
01:14:50,758 --> 01:14:53,227
Separated by quantum physics.

1198
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:54,862
It's always something.

1199
01:14:58,666 --> 01:15:03,104
I mean, there is a way for me
to be a ghost for a bit.

1200
01:15:03,237 --> 01:15:05,639
But it's-it's experimental.

1201
01:15:05,773 --> 01:15:07,641
And you wouldn't want
to risk it.

1202
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:10,745
It's not lethal.

1203
01:15:11,479 --> 01:15:12,813
That's a plus.

1204
01:15:12,947 --> 01:15:14,582
Just requires a little bit
of light breaking and entering

1205
01:15:14,715 --> 01:15:16,283
and some advanced science.

1206
01:15:16,417 --> 01:15:19,220
I mean, I wouldn't want to
get you into any more trouble.

1207
01:15:20,755 --> 01:15:22,556
What else can they do to me?

1208
01:15:47,081 --> 01:15:48,149
What is that thing?

1209
01:15:48,816 --> 01:15:50,284
It's an ionic separator.

1210
01:15:50,418 --> 01:15:51,819
It'll allow us
to temporarily exist

1211
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:54,088
on the same dimensional plane.

1212
01:15:55,456 --> 01:15:57,024
My spirit will be separated
from my body

1213
01:15:57,158 --> 01:15:58,325
for only two minutes.

1214
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:01,996
Then I'll regain consciousness.

1215
01:17:24,912 --> 01:17:25,946
Boo.

1216
01:17:31,318 --> 01:17:32,319
What's wrong?

1217
01:17:34,688 --> 01:17:35,990
I'm sorry.

1218
01:17:38,325 --> 01:17:39,326
For what?

1219
01:17:43,697 --> 01:17:45,666
A human voice is the key.

1220
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,907
But Garraka
can't control humans.

1221
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:55,176
Only ghosts.

1222
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:58,613
And now he can control you.

1223
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:14,428
Garraka's the only one that can
open the door to the other side.

1224
01:18:18,165 --> 01:18:19,300
It's my only chance.

1225
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:28,610
My only chance
to see my family again.

1226
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:35,449
Maybe one day,
you'll understand.

1227
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:19,460
Your world will shatter.

1228
01:19:20,528 --> 01:19:23,632
Bones and ice.

1229
01:19:25,833 --> 01:19:30,504
My empire will rise.

1230
01:19:40,981 --> 01:19:42,449
Hey, asshole.

1231
01:19:55,796 --> 01:19:57,231
Lucky!

1232
01:20:23,725 --> 01:20:25,359
-Phoebe?
-Over here.

1233
01:20:25,492 --> 01:20:26,860
Phoebe. Are you okay?

1234
01:20:26,994 --> 01:20:28,462
-She ghost-walked.
-What?

1235
01:20:28,596 --> 01:20:29,830
Her spirit separated
from her body.

1236
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,031
-Oh, my God, you're freezing.
-I tried to stop it.

1237
01:20:31,165 --> 01:20:32,232
-I couldn't.
-No, it's okay.

1238
01:20:32,366 --> 01:20:33,834
No, you're okay.
That's all that matters.

1239
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:35,302
-We're in trouble. We're...
-No, you're not in trouble.

1240
01:20:35,436 --> 01:20:37,572
-You're not in trouble.
-She's right.

1241
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,875
We're all in big trouble.

1242
01:20:52,086 --> 01:20:53,555
Yeah,
just give me a minute.

1243
01:20:53,688 --> 01:20:55,657
Just, uh, finishing this up.

1244
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:57,458
I'll be right with you.

1245
01:20:57,592 --> 01:21:01,095
Are you the Firemaster?

1246
01:21:01,228 --> 01:21:03,665
Yeah, man, read the damn sign.

1247
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:42,963
-I love that.
-What is that?

1248
01:23:25,807 --> 01:23:27,174
Should we call this one in?

1249
01:23:27,307 --> 01:23:29,009
Yeah, call this one in.

1250
01:23:29,142 --> 01:23:30,979
Taxi!

1251
01:23:44,358 --> 01:23:46,861
It's okay if you guys hate me.

1252
01:23:46,995 --> 01:23:48,696
We don't hate you.
We were worried about you.

1253
01:23:48,830 --> 01:23:52,266
We didn't know where you were.
You could've been killed.

1254
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,736
I trusted somebody
that I shouldn't have.

1255
01:23:54,869 --> 01:23:57,037
I just feel stupid.

1256
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,606
It's okay to feel stupid.

1257
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:00,474
Some of the smartest people
I know are morons.

1258
01:24:00,608 --> 01:24:02,877
Yeah, and I told you
to make mistakes.

1259
01:24:03,011 --> 01:24:04,913
Yeah, not release
a monstrous deity.

1260
01:24:05,045 --> 01:24:06,346
Maybe next time, get a tattoo.

1261
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:08,950
Or try shoplifting.
Hey, that'd be fun.

1262
01:24:09,082 --> 01:24:10,518
Yeah. Okay.

1263
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:13,186
Hey.

1264
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,222
Are you ready
to be a Spengler again?

1265
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:18,593
Good, 'cause we need you.

1266
01:24:18,726 --> 01:24:19,727
Yeah.

1267
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,473
Phoebe.

1268
01:24:33,608 --> 01:24:35,543
-How did Garraka get out?
-Doesn't matter.

1269
01:24:35,677 --> 01:24:37,812
It's coming right for us,
and it's really bad out there.

1270
01:24:37,946 --> 01:24:39,212
Wh-Who's coming right for us?

1271
01:24:39,346 --> 01:24:41,348
Typical manifestation of evil.

1272
01:24:41,481 --> 01:24:43,417
Ender of worlds,
that kind of thing.

1273
01:24:43,551 --> 01:24:45,319
Garraka's coming
for the containment unit

1274
01:24:45,452 --> 01:24:48,022
to recruit every ghost
in the tank we've ever caught.

1275
01:24:48,155 --> 01:24:49,857
We can't allow that to happen.

1276
01:24:49,991 --> 01:24:51,491
He'll have a veritable
army of ghosts.

1277
01:24:51,626 --> 01:24:54,194
-Army of ghosts?
-Guys, it's okay. We're fine.

1278
01:24:54,328 --> 01:24:56,196
Look, we're good. Calm down.

1279
01:24:56,330 --> 01:24:58,600
We have the Firemaster.

1280
01:25:00,167 --> 01:25:01,301
Do the thing.

1281
01:25:01,435 --> 01:25:03,071
This is really great.
You're gonna love it.

1282
01:25:04,171 --> 01:25:07,207
Okay,
just like we practiced.

1283
01:25:15,617 --> 01:25:16,651
Huh?

1284
01:25:16,784 --> 01:25:18,385
-Huh?
-Yes!

1285
01:25:21,355 --> 01:25:22,489
-Great.
-Huh?

1286
01:25:22,624 --> 01:25:23,791
Great.

1287
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:29,396
Where are our proton packs?

1288
01:25:33,768 --> 01:25:34,769
New packs.

1289
01:25:42,409 --> 01:25:43,377
Suit up.

1290
01:25:44,045 --> 01:25:45,445
Get to the roof, all right?

1291
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:48,315
Just shoot anything
that looks terrifying.

1292
01:25:48,448 --> 01:25:50,183
But I already threw
a proton stream at that thing.

1293
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:52,386
-It didn't even flinch.
-How is that possible?

1294
01:25:52,520 --> 01:25:54,421
It's an ancient god
from another dimension.

1295
01:25:54,555 --> 01:25:56,624
Who's to know
its atomic composition?

1296
01:25:58,793 --> 01:25:59,961
-Dr. Ray?
-Yeah?

1297
01:26:00,094 --> 01:26:01,763
Copper can conduct
an electrical field

1298
01:26:01,896 --> 01:26:03,598
like the one in our colliders.

1299
01:26:03,731 --> 01:26:05,833
Yeah, but there's no copper
left in the firehouse.

1300
01:26:05,967 --> 01:26:08,468
Stripped by vagrants
in the '90s.

1301
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:11,438
Well, then what about brass?

1302
01:26:12,573 --> 01:26:14,408
Brass.

1303
01:26:14,542 --> 01:26:16,878
Especially if it's
psychically charged.

1304
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:27,320
Our proton
packs use nickel and zinc

1305
01:26:27,454 --> 01:26:29,957
as primary drivers
for spectral agitation.

1306
01:26:31,391 --> 01:26:33,226
But Garraka is different.

1307
01:26:34,562 --> 01:26:37,598
The ancient ghost trappers
used brass to trap him.

1308
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:44,371
If I brass-plate
the components of my pack,

1309
01:26:44,504 --> 01:26:47,274
it could give us a chance.

1310
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:02,857
Switch me on.

1311
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:15,335
Wow, he managed
a faster decay of split time

1312
01:27:15,469 --> 01:27:17,872
and narrowed
the stream intensification.

1313
01:27:18,005 --> 01:27:19,406
Terrific new improvements.

1314
01:27:22,009 --> 01:27:22,977
Let's get to work.

1315
01:27:56,276 --> 01:27:57,545
Here we go.

1316
01:28:10,024 --> 01:28:12,160
-Can I be of any help?
-Son of a bitch.

1317
01:28:12,292 --> 01:28:14,695
-Venkman.
-You got to be kidding me.

1318
01:28:14,829 --> 01:28:16,363
Home sweet home.

1319
01:28:17,832 --> 01:28:20,101
Melnitz in uniform.

1320
01:28:20,234 --> 01:28:21,936
Looking sporty.

1321
01:28:23,805 --> 01:28:25,840
Oh.

1322
01:28:27,275 --> 01:28:28,843
Courage, anyone?

1323
01:28:42,190 --> 01:28:43,157
No, no, no, no, no,

1324
01:28:43,291 --> 01:28:44,559
I don't like that.

1325
01:28:44,692 --> 01:28:46,294
-What do you see up there?
-A trike.

1326
01:28:46,426 --> 01:28:47,829
-Tell them it's a trike.
-A what?

1327
01:28:47,962 --> 01:28:50,397
A kid's tricycle
rolling down the street

1328
01:28:50,531 --> 01:28:51,732
-on its own.
-No, no. Possessor.

1329
01:28:51,866 --> 01:28:54,135
-Possessor.
-You need to get down here now.

1330
01:28:54,268 --> 01:28:55,203
Yeah.

1331
01:29:05,345 --> 01:29:06,280
What's going on?

1332
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:07,480
Oh, it's really bad.

1333
01:29:07,615 --> 01:29:09,183
The world's ending.
Do not go up there.

1334
01:29:09,317 --> 01:29:10,685
-How's it going?
-Oh, terrible.

1335
01:29:10,818 --> 01:29:12,787
Okay,
just keep practicing, man.

1336
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,722
We got your back.

1337
01:29:14,856 --> 01:29:17,158
Could one of the adults
also come and help?

1338
01:29:32,106 --> 01:29:33,808
Whoa!

1339
01:29:52,860 --> 01:29:53,794
It's possessed!

1340
01:29:53,928 --> 01:29:55,162
Run!

1341
01:29:57,698 --> 01:29:59,834
Whoa!

1342
01:30:35,903 --> 01:30:38,940
Oh, my God.

1343
01:30:44,412 --> 01:30:46,280
Oh.

1344
01:30:46,414 --> 01:30:47,581
Gave me the fright of my life.

1345
01:30:47,715 --> 01:30:49,650
I thought you were
one of the big, scary ones.

1346
01:30:56,324 --> 01:30:57,992
How'd you get
all the way up here?

1347
01:31:02,530 --> 01:31:04,932
Ooh, paper.

1348
01:31:05,967 --> 01:31:06,767
That's random.

1349
01:31:06,901 --> 01:31:09,103
Lucky!

1350
01:31:09,236 --> 01:31:11,539
Lucky, are you okay?

1351
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:15,876
Oh, shit.

1352
01:31:18,813 --> 01:31:19,847
Trevor!

1353
01:31:40,234 --> 01:31:41,769
You're doing it!

1354
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:43,037
This is awesome!

1355
01:32:00,654 --> 01:32:02,156
I know that guy!

1356
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:06,761
I am a god.

1357
01:32:07,528 --> 01:32:08,496
Where's Phoebe?

1358
01:32:20,941 --> 01:32:22,043
Good luck.

1359
01:32:41,530 --> 01:32:43,030
So, was any of it real?

1360
01:32:44,498 --> 01:32:47,234
Yeah. I actually did
beat you at chess.

1361
01:32:56,310 --> 01:32:57,344
I never wanted to hurt you.

1362
01:32:57,478 --> 01:33:00,114
I just wanted
to see my family again.

1363
01:33:00,247 --> 01:33:01,782
Well, my family's up there now.

1364
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:04,852
We still have time
to stop this.

1365
01:33:05,986 --> 01:33:06,987
It's too late.

1366
01:33:10,624 --> 01:33:11,859
He's here.

1367
01:33:30,411 --> 01:33:32,780
Phoebe? Phoebe!

1368
01:33:43,023 --> 01:33:43,991
Heads up.

1369
01:33:44,125 --> 01:33:46,260
Tall, dark and horny
at 12 o'clock.

1370
01:33:52,266 --> 01:33:53,701
Ah!

1371
01:34:13,622 --> 01:34:15,489
Garraka can't help you move on.

1372
01:34:15,624 --> 01:34:17,158
You have to do that yourself.

1373
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:28,302
Don't let him get
to the basement!

1374
01:34:28,435 --> 01:34:29,436
How?

1375
01:34:30,539 --> 01:34:32,173
Well, being nice didn't work.

1376
01:34:36,477 --> 01:34:38,179
-Let's try this.
-Light 'em up!

1377
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:45,819
I tried to tell you guys
our throwers are useless.

1378
01:34:57,965 --> 01:35:00,434
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

1379
01:35:04,539 --> 01:35:05,873
Okay.

1380
01:35:07,741 --> 01:35:09,210
Look, dude, I'm...

1381
01:35:09,343 --> 01:35:11,445
I'm probably
your worst nightmare.

1382
01:35:12,647 --> 01:35:14,048
Okay. Okay, okay.

1383
01:35:14,949 --> 01:35:18,553
Real talk, man to... whatever.

1384
01:35:18,687 --> 01:35:19,787
I don't want to hurt you.

1385
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:21,556
Okay? So, how about
we call this even,

1386
01:35:21,690 --> 01:35:22,957
we each go our separate ways.

1387
01:35:23,090 --> 01:35:26,093
I go back to Queens,
you go back to Narnia.

1388
01:35:36,671 --> 01:35:41,275
You are no Firemaster.

1389
01:35:42,910 --> 01:35:46,247
Me? No, I'm not the Firemaster.

1390
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,749
I'm just Nadeem.

1391
01:35:48,882 --> 01:35:51,952
And let the record show
I gave you a chance.

1392
01:35:57,825 --> 01:35:59,728
Dude, did you use
all the lighter fluid?

1393
01:35:59,860 --> 01:36:01,395
You told me to practice.

1394
01:36:03,063 --> 01:36:05,432
Um, does anyone have a light?

1395
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:07,535
I-I quit smoking in the '90s.

1396
01:36:07,669 --> 01:36:09,503
Proud of you then,
proud of you now.

1397
01:36:11,071 --> 01:36:13,173
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

1398
01:36:14,475 --> 01:36:15,510
Uh...

1399
01:36:22,751 --> 01:36:25,286
Get out of the way!

1400
01:36:25,419 --> 01:36:27,488
Move!

1401
01:36:28,757 --> 01:36:30,024
Look out!

1402
01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:54,315
Bye, Phoebe.

1403
01:39:55,730 --> 01:39:57,464
Phoebe!

1404
01:40:12,981 --> 01:40:15,215
They're pinning him!
We can trap him now!

1405
01:40:43,545 --> 01:40:45,279
No!

1406
01:40:45,412 --> 01:40:47,180
We're gonna need a bigger trap.

1407
01:40:47,882 --> 01:40:48,850
It's right there.

1408
01:40:48,983 --> 01:40:50,417
Garraka's let
all the spirits out.

1409
01:40:50,552 --> 01:40:51,686
Peter, do you know
what this means?

1410
01:40:51,819 --> 01:40:53,453
You know what we could do?

1411
01:40:53,588 --> 01:40:54,722
Ray, pretend I don't.

1412
01:40:59,493 --> 01:41:02,129
If we neutralize
the mass-energy d-density

1413
01:41:02,262 --> 01:41:04,933
to reduce criticality,
it will force the tank

1414
01:41:05,065 --> 01:41:06,199
to re-prime itself
and re-reverse the polar...

1415
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:08,770
Just do it! We all trust you.

1416
01:41:17,177 --> 01:41:18,846
I can't hold him much longer!

1417
01:41:18,980 --> 01:41:21,248
-Come on!
-Hey, little help.

1418
01:41:37,665 --> 01:41:39,000
Golden years?

1419
01:41:39,132 --> 01:41:40,635
Golden years!

1420
01:42:12,466 --> 01:42:14,535
When the light is green...

1421
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:16,303
The whole world is clean.

1422
01:42:18,171 --> 01:42:20,875
I knew you had
one more dance in you.

1423
01:42:24,579 --> 01:42:27,180
Yes!

1424
01:42:27,314 --> 01:42:28,950
You're toast.

1425
01:42:49,971 --> 01:42:51,238
You were right.

1426
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:56,410
I'll see you in the fabric
of the universe.

1427
01:43:30,611 --> 01:43:31,779
Mom.

1428
01:43:50,198 --> 01:43:52,166
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1429
01:43:52,299 --> 01:43:53,634
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1430
01:43:53,768 --> 01:43:57,337
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1431
01:43:57,471 --> 01:43:58,906
-Hey!
-Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1432
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:02,476
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1433
01:44:02,610 --> 01:44:04,311
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1434
01:44:04,444 --> 01:44:05,980
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1435
01:44:13,988 --> 01:44:15,455
You have done it!

1436
01:44:16,323 --> 01:44:18,159
Citywide devastation.

1437
01:44:18,291 --> 01:44:20,595
I am putting you away
for a long ti...

1438
01:44:20,728 --> 01:44:22,262
Peck.

1439
01:44:22,395 --> 01:44:24,132
You clown.

1440
01:44:24,264 --> 01:44:25,298
You're never gonna
get it, are you?

1441
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:26,701
Mr. Mayor!

1442
01:44:26,834 --> 01:44:28,401
What do you have to say
to the Ghostbusters?

1443
01:44:28,536 --> 01:44:30,238
Hey, how about
you thank them, dickless!

1444
01:44:30,370 --> 01:44:32,206
Wh-What... Uh, yes.

1445
01:44:32,339 --> 01:44:34,407
It sounds like we have
your undivided support.

1446
01:44:34,542 --> 01:44:35,943
Love you, Ghostbusters!

1447
01:44:36,077 --> 01:44:38,212
Uh, w-well, y-yes, of course.

1448
01:44:38,345 --> 01:44:40,014
Good. I'm so happy
to hear that, Mr. Mayor,

1449
01:44:40,148 --> 01:44:43,117
because without Phoebe
and her family, this whole city

1450
01:44:43,251 --> 01:44:44,919
would be under
three feet of ice.

1451
01:44:45,052 --> 01:44:46,486
Yeah.

1452
01:44:46,621 --> 01:44:51,726
We know that
the world right now

1453
01:44:51,859 --> 01:44:55,963
is experiencing
unusual paranormal activity.

1454
01:44:56,097 --> 01:44:58,398
We are here to answer that call

1455
01:44:58,533 --> 01:45:01,468
because we are
the Ghostbusters!

1456
01:45:06,741 --> 01:45:09,677
Well, it's not
my first evil god.

1457
01:45:09,811 --> 01:45:11,045
I am Nadeem.

1458
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:14,447
I am a Firemaster, turns out.

1459
01:45:14,582 --> 01:45:16,349
Like my dadi before me.

1460
01:45:22,256 --> 01:45:23,658
Did we... did we win?

1461
01:45:23,791 --> 01:45:26,127
Busting ghosts together--
what do you call that?

1462
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:27,327
-It's a team.
-A family.

1463
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,428
Yeah. The Spenglers.

1464
01:45:28,563 --> 01:45:29,764
-We're the Spenglers.
-Okay.

1465
01:45:29,897 --> 01:45:31,464
Well, you don't want to be
a Grooberson. Trust me.

1466
01:45:35,468 --> 01:45:36,904
Okay, uh, guys, maybe put on
your packs.

1467
01:45:37,038 --> 01:45:38,039
Uh, okay.

1468
01:45:38,172 --> 01:45:39,406
All right, Dad.

1469
01:45:40,875 --> 01:45:42,543
Gary. Sorry.

1470
01:45:43,978 --> 01:45:45,580
Yeah, I heard it.

1471
01:45:45,713 --> 01:45:47,882
Trevor! Keys.

1472
01:45:48,015 --> 01:45:49,817
She just called me Dad.

1473
01:45:54,188 --> 01:45:55,388
Yeah!

1474
01:45:55,890 --> 01:45:56,958
Okay.

1475
01:45:57,091 --> 01:45:58,893
There are a lot of people,
so go slowly.

1476
01:45:59,026 --> 01:46:00,360
Look both ways.

1477
01:48:52,299 --> 01:48:53,467
Hey, that's my truck!

1478
01:48:55,302 --> 01:48:57,071
That's my truck!

1479
01:49:03,310 --> 01:49:05,146
That's my truck, man!
